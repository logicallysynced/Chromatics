# Changelog

All notable changes to Chromatics are documented here.

## 4.0.154

- Fixed an issue where Chromatics could close itself with a crash dialog if a connected device (Hue, OpenRGB, etc.) had a brief network hiccup. These transient errors are now ignored.
- Saving your layer setup is more reliable: if antivirus, OneDrive, or Dropbox briefly locks the file, Chromatics will retry rather than failing the save.
- Quietened expected startup messages — if iCUE or OpenRGB isn't running, the app no longer treats it as a crash report.

## 4.0.153

Initial public release of Chromatics 4.0
